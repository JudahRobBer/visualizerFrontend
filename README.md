## Introduction
"code-learning-env" is an innovative web application designed to facilitate the learning of programming and researching the influence of AI on programming education. By integrating AI with a code execution environment, it offers a unique platform for learners and researchers to write, test, and learn from code snippets interactively.

## Target Audience
This application is suitable for:
- **Learners**: Individuals looking to practice and improve their programming skills through interactive challenges.
- **Researchers**: Experts investigating how AI tools can support and enhance learning in the field of computer programming.

## Core Functionalities
- **Task Description Panel**: Presents users with coding challenges that they can solve to learn or test their coding knowledge.
- **Code Writing and Interpreter Window**: A dual-purpose space that allows users to write Python code and see immediate feedback on execution. It enforces correct Python syntax, and any errors in the code will be reported in this area.
- **AI Instruction Composer**: Users can type in natural language instructions for the AI, which then assists by generating code, offering suggestions, or explaining concepts based on the user's input and current code.
- **Python Documentation Access**: Provides handy access to official Python documentation, aiding users in understanding and utilizing Python's rich set of features and libraries.


## Technology Stack
- **Next.js**: A React framework for building user interfaces and static websites.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript providing static type checking.
- **ESLint**: A static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns in JavaScript code.
